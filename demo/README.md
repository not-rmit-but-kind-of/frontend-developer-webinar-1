# Demo project

The project demonstrates basic HTML and CSS. The demo website is not responsive and has been built to be used/shown using a typical desktop viewport. In webinar 2 we will explore making this demo responsive at different viewports. 

Please excuse the UX skills :)

You have two options to getting the demo project up and running: 

## 1. Just want to see the demo and I don't want to install anything (option 1)

Simply navigate to the path of the index.html file in your browser of choice and hit \<Enter\>. 

Whenever you make changes to any of the files you will need to refresh the browser twice to see those changes.

## 2. Happy to install things to see the demo if it gives me hot reload capabilties (option 2)

This gives you hot reload (watch mode) capabilities, so no more refreshing the browser twice to see your changes. 

Pre-requisities 
- NodeJS https://nodejs.org/en/ (a recent version)
- Run `npm install` in this directory

Starting the demo
- `npm start`
- The above step should automatically navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8080/ in your default browser.
- Edit any html css file and watch the browser automatically show your changes.
